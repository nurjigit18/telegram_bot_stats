Suppliers fill the orders through the bot which saves them into Google Sheet, and suppliers can change the current status of the order, so managers can track the orders easily. 
In addition, bot helps to manage a large number of clients by: providing QR with order information, providing monthly reports, sending announcement (can be scheduled), editing/deleting existing orders, receiving payment receipts (image or file).
